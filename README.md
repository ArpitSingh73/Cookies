# Web3Wallet

My first project of Web3.0 world. It is a wallet which allows others to pay me Ethers. App is fully decentralized and is deployed on Etherium Blockchain. I learned and implemented :-
Creating digital contracts ✔
Connecting normal React app to Blockchain ✔
Solidity ✔
Hardhat ✔
etc.


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
